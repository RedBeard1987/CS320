How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing my code will help keep my code functional and secure. Using different testing techniques such as automated testing with manual regression testing can ensure functionality and safety.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By remembering user experience is key to any software program. If the user experience isn't easy to use and the program is too complicated it can frustrate users and make them shy away from the program or find other programs that are easier to use. Keeping this in mind when designing a program can make for better software developers. I incorporate this in my code by trying to keep the code simple and reuseable. Keeping code functions small and not too complex can allow code to be tested easier.

How do I approach designing software?

I test often while maintaining simplicity and functionality. This also helps with integration of code. It allows for easier debugging and using automated testing can be very cost and time efficient.
